# rGuard
Build your online software business, for free.

# About
I like to release programs online to make some extra cash. However, we do not live in a perfect world, and thus there are people out there who like to steal code. Instead of pouring out my money into somebody else's licensing system, especially when I don't know how secure they are, I preferred to roll my own. rGuard exists as a forever free, forever open-source alternative to popular licensing systems.

# Caveats
rGuard is more than a licensing system. It is a complete Laravel-based MVC website through which you can sell programs and restrict files, in addition to selling licenses. rGuard includes a full admin panel, HTTPS support, Card/PayPal/Bitcoin support, and even allows to you to embed a WordPress blog.
